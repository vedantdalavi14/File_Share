## <a name="-getting-started"></a>üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vedantdalavi14/File_Share.git
    cd File_Share
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following keys. You will need a Supabase account for this.

    ```env
    # Public key for the Supabase client (frontend)
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

    # Secret service role key for Supabase admin (backend)
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
    ```

### Running the Application

-   **Development Mode:**
    Starts the Vite frontend and the Node.js backend concurrently.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

-   **Production Build:**
    Builds the frontend and backend for production.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

-   **Start in Production:**
    Starts the application from the compiled `dist` folder.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## <a name="-project-architecture"></a>üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The application follows a monorepo-style structure with a `client` and `server` directory.

-   **`/server`**: The Express.js backend that serves as the signaling server for WebRTC. It uses Socket.IO to manage rooms and pass signaling messages between peers. It also provides API endpoints for server-based file uploads and room management.
-   **`/client`**: The React application built with Vite. It contains all the UI components and the client-side logic for WebRTC connections, file transfers, and chat.
-   **`/shared`**: Contains shared code, such as database schemas, that can be used by both the client and the server.

### File Sharing Flow

#### P2P File Transfer
1.  A sender selects a file, and a new room is created on the server.
2.  A shareable link is generated, which the sender shares with a receiver.
3.  The receiver joins the room, and the signaling server notifies both users.
4.  A WebRTC connection is negotiated through the signaling server.
5.  Once the P2P connection is established, the file is transferred in chunks directly between the two peers.

#### Server-Based File Transfer
1.  A user uploads a file, and the client requests a secure signed URL from the server.
2.  The client uploads the file directly to Supabase Storage.
3.  Upon completion, the server creates a metadata record and returns a final shareable download link.
